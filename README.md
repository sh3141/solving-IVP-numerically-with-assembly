# solving-differential-equations-numerically-with-assembly
This MIPS assembly code numerically solves a given IVP : y'= 224*x^3 -36*x^2 +39x + 226*y^3 -2*y^2 -68y -2 with initial condition y(0)=0 using Euler's method for step size h=1. It can solve for y(n) where n is a positive integer the user selects.
